\begin{frame}{1993 Final Report and Recommendations}

"{\color{red}To offset the potential for the proposed rule curve modifications to increase the frequency of spring flood events}, the IJC should enforce the provision of its 1970 Supplemental Order {\color{red} requiring the dam operators to anticipate inflows and maximize the discharge capabilities of the dams to prevent emergency water levels}. 

"The Steering Committee believes that {\color{red} diligent use of the existing network of upstream lake level gauges and currently available hydrologic models can make this IJC mandate a reality and improve the accuracy and reliability of reservoir level control}."

\begin{frame}{Conclusions}

{\bf The rule curve review needs to include control implementation within the scope of its work.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Contrary to the 1993 Report, there is little evidence for "diligent use of existing network of upstream lake level gauges and currently available hydrological models can make this IJC mandate a reality and improve the accuracy and reliability of reservoir level control."

\item The 2000 rule curves are not a feasible mandate for level management on Rainy Lake.

\item  Consideration should be given to an integrated control strategy for flow control points on the Rainy-Lake of the Woods watershed coupled with significant rule curve revisions.
	
\end{enumerate}

The main focus of this work is to provide insight into the challenges and opportunities for control of water levels on a prototypical lake system in the Canadian Shield.

\begin{frame}{Advanced Control for Rainy and Namakan Lake Levels}

{\bf Develop multivariable MPC model for the control of Rainy Lake. Develop historical comparisons and tune on a training set. Demonstrate relative performance for select years.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Fully implement the 2000 Rule Curve order, with a facility to explore changes to essential components. Implement, train, and test
\begin{enumerate}
\item Baseline control to the median of the rule curve.
\item Control to other quantiles of the rule curve.
\item Multiloop PID control.
\item Implement MPC control.
\item Implement Stochastic MPC.	
\end{enumerate}
\item Develop a recommended control strategy for testing and implementation by the IJC.
\end{enumerate}

Would the proposed controls have had a beneficial impact during the 2014 flooding events?
